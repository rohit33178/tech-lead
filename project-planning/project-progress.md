Here are the major points to monitor project progress and identify overcommitment:

Monitoring Project Progress:

1. _Regular Status Updates_: Hold regular team meetings or status updates to track progress.
2. _Project Management Tools_: Utilize tools like project management software, Gantt charts, or Kanban boards to visualize progress.
3. _Performance Metrics_: Establish key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure progress, such as task completion rates or burn-down rates.
4. _Task Completion Tracking_: Track task completion and update the project schedule accordingly.
5. _Milestone Achievement_: Verify achievement of milestones and adjust the project plan as needed.
6. _Team Member Feedback_: Encourage team members to provide feedback on progress and potential roadblocks.
7. _Stakeholder Updates_: Provide regular updates to stakeholders on project progress and any changes.
8. _Issue and Risk Tracking_: Identify and track issues and risks, developing mitigation plans as needed.
9. _Schedule Performance Index (SPI)_: Calculate SPI to measure progress against the project schedule.
10. _Earned Value Management (EVM)_: Use EVM to measure progress, cost, and schedule performance.

Identifying Overcommitment:

1. _Task Overload_: Identify team members with an excessive workload or unrealistic deadlines.
2. _Unrealistic Timelines_: Recognize timelines that are overly aggressive or unachievable.
3. _Resource Constraints_: Identify insufficient resources, including personnel, equipment, or budget.
4. _Scope Creep_: Detect changes in project scope that may lead to overcommitment.
5. _Team Member Burnout_: Monitor team members for signs of burnout, such as decreased productivity or morale.
6. _Deadline Delays_: Identify delays in task completion or milestone achievement.
7. _Budget Overruns_: Track expenses and identify potential budget overruns.
8. _Quality Compromise_: Recognize situations where quality may be compromised due to overcommitment.
9. _Communication Breakdowns_: Identify communication gaps or issues that may lead to overcommitment.
10. _Lack of Flexibility_: Detect inflexibility in the project plan, making it difficult to adapt to changes or unexpected issues.

By monitoring project progress and identifying potential overcommitment, you can take proactive measures to ensure successful project completion.
