Here are step-by-step explanations of each estimation technique:


*Story Points Estimation*


1. Define a scale (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 5, 8) to represent relative complexity.
2. Gather team members for estimation discussion.
3. Read user story description and acceptance criteria.
4. Ask team members to silently choose a story point value.
5. Share individual estimates and discuss discrepancies.
6. Reach consensus on a single story point value.


Example:


| Story Points | Complexity |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Simple |
| 2 | Medium |
| 3 | Medium-Complex |
| 5 | Complex |
| 8 | Very Complex |


*T-Shirt Sizing Estimation*


1. Define a scale (e.g., XS, S, M, L, XL) to represent relative complexity.
2. Gather team members for estimation discussion.
3. Read user story description and acceptance criteria.
4. Ask team members to silently choose a T-Shirt size.
5. Share individual estimates and discuss discrepancies.
6. Reach consensus on a single T-Shirt size.


Example:


| T-Shirt Size | Complexity |
| --- | --- |
| XS | Very Simple |
| S | Simple |
| M | Medium |
| L | Complex |
| XL | Very Complex |


*Hours Estimation*


1. Break down user story into smaller tasks.
2. Estimate time required for each task in hours.
3. Consider complexity, risk, and uncertainty.
4. Add buffers for unexpected issues.
5. Calculate total estimated hours.


Example:


| Task | Estimated Hours |
| --- | --- |
| Research | 2 hours |
| Design | 4 hours |
| Development | 8 hours |
| Testing | 2 hours |
| Total | 16 hours |


*Planning Poker Estimation*


1. Gather team members for estimation discussion.
2. Read user story description and acceptance criteria.
3. Each team member chooses a card with a value (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 5, 8).
4. Share individual estimates and discuss discrepancies.
5. Repeat until consensus is reached.


Example:


| Team Member | Card Value |
| --- | --- |
| Developer 1 | 5 |
| Developer 2 | 3 |
| Designer | 2 |
| QA Engineer | 5 |
| Consensus | 5 |


*Three-Point Estimation*


1. Estimate three values for each task:
    - Best-case (optimistic)
    - Most-likely (realistic)
    - Worst-case (pessimistic)
2. Calculate average estimated value.
3. Consider complexity, risk, and uncertainty.


Example:


| Task | Best-Case | Most-Likely | Worst-Case | Average |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Research | 1 hour | 2 hours | 4 hours | 2.33 hours |
| Design | 2 hours | 4 hours | 6 hours | 4 hours |
| Development | 8 hours | 12 hours | 16 hours | 12 hours |

These estimation techniques help teams create more accurate and reliable estimates, improving project planning and delivery.
