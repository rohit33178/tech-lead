Here are some questions to help identify risk factors and blockers during user story estimation:

*Technical Risk Factors*

1. Are there any unclear or complex technical requirements?
2. Are we using new or untested technologies?
3. Are there dependencies on third-party APIs or services?
4. Are there potential performance or scalability issues?
5. Are there security or compliance concerns?

*Non-Technical Risk Factors*

1. Are stakeholder expectations unclear or conflicting?
2. Are there regulatory or compliance requirements?
3. Are there potential changes in business priorities?
4. Are there dependencies on external teams or vendors?
5. Are there cultural or organizational challenges?

*Estimation Blockers*

1. Is the user story unclear or ambiguous?
2. Are acceptance criteria incomplete or unclear?
3. Are there unresolved technical questions or assumptions?
4. Are there insufficient resources (time, people, budget)?
5. Are there conflicting priorities or dependencies?

*Team-Related Risk Factors*

1. Is the team unfamiliar with the technology or domain?
2. Are team members unavailable or over-allocated?
3. Are there skill gaps or knowledge deficiencies?
4. Are there communication or collaboration challenges?
5. Are there potential team turnover or retention issues?

*External Risk Factors*

1. Are there dependencies on external vendors or suppliers?
2. Are there potential changes in market conditions?
3. Are there regulatory or compliance changes?
4. Are there potential disruptions to infrastructure?
5. Are there natural disaster or business continuity risks?

*Questions to Clarify Assumptions*

1. What are the key assumptions behind this estimate?
2. Have we considered all relevant factors?
3. Are there any unknowns or uncertainties?
4. Have we consulted with subject matter experts?
5. Are there any potential risks or mitigations?

*Questions to Identify Blockers*

1. What are the critical path dependencies?
2. Are there any blocking issues or obstacles?
3. Are there insufficient resources or capacity?
4. Are there conflicting priorities or deadlines?
5. Are there potential roadblocks or showstoppers?

By asking these questions, teams can identify potential risk factors and blockers, and develop strategies to mitigate or address them, ultimately improving the accuracy and reliability of user story estimates.

*Next Steps:*

1. Document identified risk factors and blockers.
2. Develop mitigation strategies.
3. Update estimates to reflect risks and uncertainties.
4. Continuously monitor and review risks and blockers.
5. Adjust estimates and plans accordingly.
