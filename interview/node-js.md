6. How does Node's module system work? Explain the difference between require and import, and how you would use each.
7. What is a Node package manager (npm), and how does it differ from a package manager like yarn? Provide an example of when you would use each.
8. How do you optimize Node performance? Explain the use of tools like Chrome DevTools, Node Inspector, and Benchmark.js.
9. What is Node's security model, and how does it relate to common web vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS)? Provide an example of how you would secure a Node application.
10. How does Node's non-blocking I/O model impact application design? Provide an example of how you would design an application to take advantage of non-blocking I/O.
