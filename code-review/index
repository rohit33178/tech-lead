Here are the major key points to focus on while doing code review for a backend API development with Express JS as a Tech Lead:

Here are some checklist pointers for the above list:

Code Organization and Structure

- Is the project folder structure organized and consistent?
- Are there clear separations of concerns between routes, controllers, and services?
- Are there appropriate naming conventions for files and folders?
- Is the code organized in a logical and consistent manner?

Security

- Are passwords and sensitive data properly encrypted and stored?
- Are there proper authentication and authorization mechanisms in place?
- Are there protections against common web attacks (e.g. SQL injection, cross-site scripting)?
- Are dependencies up-to-date and free from known vulnerabilities?

Performance and Optimization

- Are database queries optimized for performance?
- Are there appropriate caching mechanisms in place?
- Are there optimizations for high traffic and large data sets?
- Are there proper indexing and partitioning in place?

Error Handling and Logging

- Are there proper error handling mechanisms in place (e.g. try-catch blocks, error middleware)?
- Are errors properly logged and monitored (e.g. using a logging library like Winston)?
- Are there appropriate error responses and status codes?
- Are errors properly handled and logged in all parts of the code?

Code Quality and Best Practices

- Are there consistent coding standards and best practices followed (e.g. Airbnb style guide)?
- Are there proper code comments and documentation (e.g. JSDoc)?
- Are there appropriate use of design patterns and principles (e.g. SOLID principles)?
- Is the code readable and maintainable?

Testing and Validation

- Are there sufficient unit tests and integration tests in place (e.g. using Jest or Mocha)?
- Are there proper validation mechanisms for user input and data (e.g. using Joi or Express-Validator)?
- Are there appropriate test coverage and code coverage metrics?
- Are tests properly maintained and updated?

API Design and Documentation

- Are there clear and consistent API endpoints and documentation (e.g. using Swagger or API Blueprint)?
- Are there appropriate API request and response formats (e.g. JSON, XML)?
- Are there proper API versioning and backwards compatibility measures?
- Is the API documentation up-to-date and accurate?

Dependency Management

- Are there appropriate dependencies declared and managed (e.g. using npm or yarn)?
- Are there proper dependency versions and updates?
- Are there appropriate measures for dependency security and vulnerabilities?
- Are dependencies properly documented and maintained?

Code Reusability and Modularity

- Are there reusable code modules and functions?
- Are there appropriate modularization of code (e.g. using ES modules or CommonJS)?
- Are there proper code reuse and minimization of duplication?
- Is the code organized in a modular and reusable way?

Code Style and Consistency

- Are there consistent code styles and formatting (e.g. using Prettier or ESLint)?
- Are there appropriate code naming conventions and consistency?
- Are there proper code whitespace and indentation?
- Is the code properly formatted and consistent?

These checklist pointers can help you ensure that your codebase meets the requirements and best practices for backend API development with Express JS.

By focusing on these key areas, you can ensure that the codebase is maintainable, scalable, and follows best practices for backend API development with Express JS.
