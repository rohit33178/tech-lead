Here are the important steps to confirm code is clean and readable:

1. _Consistent Indentation_: Check for consistent indentation using spaces or tabs.
2. _Clear Variable Names_: Verify variable names are descriptive, concise, and follow a naming convention.
3. _Function Length_: Ensure functions are short and focused, avoiding long and complex logic.
4. _Code Comments_: Check for clear, concise, and explanatory comments.
5. _Code Organization_: Verify code is organized in a logical and consistent manner.
6. _Minimal Nesting_: Ensure minimal nesting of conditional statements and loops.
7. _Consistent Spacing_: Check for consistent spacing between lines, functions, and blocks.
8. _Readability_: Verify code is easy to read and understand, avoiding complex expressions.
9. _Simple Expressions_: Ensure simple expressions are used instead of complex ones.
10. _Consistent Naming Conventions_: Verify consistent naming conventions for variables, functions, and classes.
11. _Avoid Duplicate Code_: Check for duplicate code and extract common logic into functions.
12. _Code Formatting_: Verify code is formatted consistently using tools like Prettier or Black.
13. _Clear Error Handling_: Ensure clear and concise error handling and logging.
14. _Minimal Code Complexity_: Verify code has minimal complexity, avoiding deep nesting and long functions.
15. _Consistent Return Statements_: Check for consistent return statements and avoid multiple returns in functions.
16. _Code Clarity_: Verify code is clear and concise, avoiding ambiguity and uncertainty.
17. _Function Separation_: Ensure functions are separated by clear and consistent boundaries.
18. _Code Consistency_: Verify code consistency in syntax, naming, and style.
19. _Avoid Dead Code_: Check for dead code and remove unused code.
20. _Code Review_: Perform regular code reviews to ensure code quality and readability.

By following these steps, you can ensure your code is clean, readable, and maintainable, making it easier for others to understand and work with.
