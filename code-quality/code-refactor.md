Here are the important steps to confirm code follows the "Refactor Mercilessly" principle:

_Refactoring_

1. _Identify code smells_: Identify code smells, such as duplication, long methods, and dead code.
2.     - Analyze code structure*: Analyze code structure and identify areas for improvement.
3. _Simplify code_: Simplify code by removing unnecessary complexity.
4. _Extract functions_: Extract functions to reduce duplication and improve modularity.
5. _Improve naming_: Improve naming conventions to make code more readable.
6. _Reduce coupling_: Reduce coupling between functions and modules.
7. _Improve cohesion_: Improve cohesion within functions and modules.
8. _Remove dead code_: Remove dead code and unused variables.
9. _Optimize performance_: Optimize performance by reducing computational complexity.
10. _Improve readability_: Improve readability by using clear and concise code.
11. _Use design patterns_: Use design patterns to solve common problems.
12. _Keep functions short_: Keep functions short and focused.
13. _Avoid duplicated code_: Avoid duplicated code and logic.
14. _Use refactoring tools_: Use refactoring tools like Resharper or PyCharm to aid in refactoring.
15. _Test after refactoring_: Test code after refactoring to ensure functionality is preserved.

_Best Practices_

1. _Refactor regularly_: Refactor regularly to maintain code quality.
2. _Use version control_: Use version control to track changes and collaborate with team members.
3. _Write automated tests_: Write automated tests to ensure refactoring doesn't break functionality.
4. _Code review_: Perform code reviews to ensure refactoring improves code quality.
5. _Continuous Integration_: Integrate refactoring into the CI pipeline.
6. _Document changes_: Document changes and reasons for refactoring.
7. _Improve code organization_: Improve code organization and structure.
8. _Reduce technical debt_: Reduce technical debt by refactoring legacy code.

By following these steps and best practices, you can ensure your code is maintainable, efficient, and easy to understand.
