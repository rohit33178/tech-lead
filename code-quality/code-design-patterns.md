Here are the important steps to confirm code follows the best and suitable design patterns:

1. _Identify the problem_: Identify the problem or challenge you're trying to solve.
2. _Choose a pattern_: Choose a design pattern that best fits the problem.
3. _Understand the pattern_: Understand the pattern's intent, structure, and consequences.
4. _Apply the pattern_: Apply the pattern to your code, adapting it as needed.
5. _Test and refine_: Test the code and refine it to ensure it works as intended.
6. _Consider alternatives_: Consider alternative patterns or approaches.
7. _Evaluate trade-offs_: Evaluate trade-offs and make informed decisions.
8. _Document the decision_: Document the decision and the reasoning behind it.
9. _Review and refactor_: Regularly review and refactor code to ensure it remains maintainable and efficient.
10. _Consider scalability_: Consider scalability and performance implications.
11. _Use pattern catalogs_: Use pattern catalogs and resources to stay up-to-date with best practices.
12. _Collaborate with others_: Collaborate with others to get feedback and improve the design.

_Best Practices_

1. _Use patterns appropriately_: Use patterns appropriately, avoiding over-engineering or misapplication.
2. _Keep it simple_: Keep the design simple and focused on the problem at hand.
3. _Avoid over-reliance_: Avoid over-reliance on a single pattern or approach.
4. _Consider the context_: Consider the specific context and requirements of the project.
5. _Stay flexible_: Stay flexible and adaptable, willing to adjust the design as needed.
6. _Use patterns to communicate_: Use patterns to communicate design intent and ideas to others.
7. _Continuously learn_: Continuously learn and improve your understanding of design patterns.
8. _Use design principles_: Use design principles to guide your decisions and ensure a cohesive design.
9. _Keep the code maintainable_: Keep the code maintainable, readable, and easy to understand.
10. _Use automated tools_: Use automated tools and linters to help enforce design patterns and best practices.

By following these steps and best practices, you can ensure your code follows the best and suitable design patterns, making it more maintainable, efficient, and scalable.
