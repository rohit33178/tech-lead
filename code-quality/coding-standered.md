Here are the important steps to confirm code follows coding standards:

1. *Code Review*: Manually review code against the coding standards.
2. *Linting Tools*: Use linters like ESLint, TSLint, or PyLint to automatically check code for syntax and style errors.
3. *Code Formatters*: Use formatters like Prettier or Black to enforce consistent code formatting.
4. *Code Analysis Tools*: Use tools like SonarQube, CodeCoverage, or CodeHeat to analyze code quality and complexity.
5. *Automated Tests*: Run automated tests to ensure code functionality and correctness.
6. *Code Sniffers*: Use code sniffers like PHPStan or Psalm to detect code smells and errors.
7. *Consistency Checks*: Check for consistent naming conventions, indentation, and syntax.
8. *Best Practice Checks*: Verify adherence to best practices for security, performance, and maintainability.
9. *Code Metrics*: Calculate metrics like cyclomatic complexity, Halstead complexity, and maintainability index.
10. *Documentation*: Check for accurate and up-to-date documentation.
11. *Style Guide*: Verify code adheres to the project's style guide.
12. *Code Organization*: Ensure code is organized in a logical and consistent manner.
13. *Error Handling*: Check for proper error handling and logging.
14. *Security*: Verify code follows security best practices.
15. *Code Smell Detection*: Identify and address code smells.
16. *Code Refactoring*: Refactor code to improve quality and maintainability.
17. *Code Quality Reports*: Generate reports on code quality and areas for improvement.
18. *Continuous Integration*: Integrate code quality checks into the CI pipeline.
19. *Code Review Tools*: Use tools like GitHub, Bitbucket, or Gerrit for code review.
20. *Code Quality Gates*: Set up quality gates to ensure code meets standards before merging or deploying.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your code adheres to the coding standards and is maintainable, efficient, and reliable.
