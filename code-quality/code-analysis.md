Here are the important steps to confirm code follows analysis tools like linters, formatters, and security scanners during development:

_Linters_

1. _Integrate linters into IDE_: Integrate linters into your IDE or code editor.
2. _Configure linter rules_: Configure linter rules to match project requirements.
3. _Run linters regularly_: Run linters regularly, ideally on every code change.
4. _Address linter warnings_: Address linter warnings and errors promptly.
5. _Customize linter settings_: Customize linter settings to ignore false positives or unnecessary warnings.

_Formatters_

1. _Integrate formatters into IDE_: Integrate formatters into your IDE or code editor.
2. _Configure formatter settings_: Configure formatter settings to match project requirements.
3. _Run formatters regularly_: Run formatters regularly, ideally on every code change.
4. _Use consistent formatting_: Use consistent formatting throughout the codebase.
5. _Customize formatter settings_: Customize formatter settings to ignore specific files or code sections.

_Security Scanners_

1. _Integrate security scanners into CI/CD pipeline_: Integrate security scanners into your CI/CD pipeline.
2. _Configure security scanner rules_: Configure security scanner rules to match project requirements.
3. _Run security scanners regularly_: Run security scanners regularly, ideally on every code change.
4. _Address security vulnerabilities_: Address security vulnerabilities promptly.
5. _Customize security scanner settings_: Customize security scanner settings to ignore false positives or unnecessary warnings.

_Best Practices_

1. _Use linters and formatters together_: Use linters and formatters together to ensure code quality and consistency.
2. _Use security scanners in CI/CD pipeline_: Use security scanners in CI/CD pipeline to ensure security vulnerabilities are caught early.
3. _Configure tools to ignore false positives_: Configure tools to ignore false positives or unnecessary warnings.
4. _Use automated tools to simplify analysis_: Use automated tools to simplify analysis and reduce manual effort.
5. _Integrate analysis tools into development workflow_: Integrate analysis tools into your development workflow to ensure consistent code quality and security.

By following these steps and best practices, you can ensure your code follows analysis tools like linters, formatters, and security scanners during development, making it more maintainable, efficient, and secure.
