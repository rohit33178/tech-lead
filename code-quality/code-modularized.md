Here are the important steps to confirm code follows modularized code principles:

1. _Breakdown Large Functions_: Divide large functions into smaller, focused functions.
2. _Single Responsibility Principle_: Ensure each function has a single responsibility and purpose.
3. _Reusable Functions_: Identify and extract reusable code into separate functions.
4. _Modular Structure_: Organize code into modular structures like modules, packages, or libraries.
5. _Clear Function Names_: Use descriptive and concise names for functions and modules.
6. _Function Length_: Ensure functions are short and focused, avoiding long and complex logic.
7. _Minimal Dependencies_: Minimize dependencies between functions and modules.
8. _Loose Coupling_: Ensure loose coupling between functions and modules.
9. _High Cohesion_: Ensure high cohesion within functions and modules.
10. _Avoid Duplicate Code_: Check for duplicate code and extract common logic into reusable functions.
11. _Function Composition_: Compose functions to achieve complex tasks.
12. _Module Interface_: Define clear interfaces for modules and functions.
13. _Testable Functions_: Ensure functions are testable and have clear inputs and outputs.
14. _Code Reusability_: Verify code reusability and avoid duplicated logic.
15. _Modular Comments_: Use comments to explain the purpose and behavior of each module.
16. _Function Documentation_: Document functions with clear descriptions and usage examples.
17. _Module Organization_: Organize modules in a logical and consistent manner.
18. _Avoid God Objects_: Avoid large, complex objects that manipulate multiple modules.
19. _Avoid Long Parameter Lists_: Avoid long parameter lists in functions.
20. _Code Review_: Perform regular code reviews to ensure modular code quality.

By following these steps, you can ensure your code is modular, reusable, and maintainable, making it easier to develop, test, and maintain.
