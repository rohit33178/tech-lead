1. What is your experience with Node versions (e.g., Node 14, Node 16)? How have you handled version upgrades?
2. How do you handle errors and exceptions in Node? Can you explain the try-catch block and error-first callback approach?
3. What is your understanding of Node's event-driven, non-blocking I/O model? How have you leveraged this in your applications?
4. Can you explain the concept of a Node cluster and how you would implement it?
5. How do you optimize Node performance? What tools have you used for profiling and benchmarking?
6. What is your experience with Node streams? How have you used them in your applications?
7. Can you explain the differences between Node's built-in HTTP server and a framework like Express?
8. How do you handle security in Node, such as authentication and authorization?
9. What is the difference between Node's asynchronous and synchronous APIs? Provide an example of each.
10. How does Node's event loop work? Explain the phases of the event loop and how they relate to asynchronous programming.
11. What is a Node cluster, and how does it differ from a single Node process? Provide an example of when you would use a cluster.
12. How do you handle errors in Node? Explain the try-catch block, error-first callback approach, and uncaughtException event.
13. What is a Node stream, and how does it differ from a traditional callback-based approach? Provide an example of when you would use a stream.
14. How does Node's module system work? Explain the difference between require and import, and how you would use each.
15. What is a Node package manager (npm), and how does it differ from a package manager like yarn? Provide an example of when you would use each.
16. How do you optimize Node performance? Explain the use of tools like Chrome DevTools, Node Inspector, and Benchmark.js.
17. What is Node's security model, and how does it relate to common web vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS)? Provide an example of how you would secure a Node application.
18. How does Node's non-blocking I/O model impact application design? Provide an example of how you would design an application to take advantage of non-blocking I/O.
