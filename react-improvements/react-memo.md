## React Memo
What is React Memo?

React Memo is a hook that lets you cache the result of a calculation between re-renders. It takes a function that calculates a value and an array of dependencies as arguments. If the dependencies haven't changed since the last render, React Memo will return the cached value instead of recalculating it.

### How does it improve a React application?

React Memo can improve a React application in several ways:

- Skipping expensive recalculations: React Memo can cache the result of an expensive calculation, such as filtering a large array or transforming data, and skip recalculating it if the dependencies haven't changed. This can improve performance by avoiding unnecessary work.

- Skipping re-rendering of components: React Memo can also help optimize the performance of re-rendering child components. By caching the calculation of a prop passed to a child component, you can tell the child component to skip re-rendering if the prop hasn't changed.

- Memoizing dependencies of other Hooks: React Memo can be used to memoize dependencies of other Hooks, such as useMemo or useCallback, to avoid recalculating them unnecessarily.

### Why should you use React Memo?

You should use React Memo in the following situations:

- Expensive calculations: If you have a calculation that is expensive and doesn't depend on changing props or state, use React Memo to cache the result and skip recalculating it unnecessarily.

- Frequent re-renders: If your component re-renders frequently and you want to optimize performance, use React Memo to cache calculations that don't depend on changing props or state.

- Passing props to child components: If you pass a prop to a child component and want to optimize its re-rendering performance, use React Memo to cache the calculation of the prop and skip re-rendering if it hasn't changed.

In summary, React Memo is a powerful hook that can help improve the performance of your React application by caching calculations and skipping unnecessary re-renders. It's especially useful for expensive calculations, frequent re-renders, and passing props to child components.

#### Here are the possible ways to implement React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders in React JS:

1. React.memo:

```
import React from 'react';

const MyComponent = React.memo(() => {
  // component code here
});
```
2. React.memo with dependencies:
```
import React from 'react';

const MyComponent = React.memo(() => {
  // component code here
}, [dep1, dep2, dep3]);
```
3. React.memo with a custom comparison function:
```
import React from 'react';

const MyComponent = React.memo(() => {
  // component code here
}, (prevProps, nextProps) => {
  // custom comparison logic here
});
```
4. React.memo with a areEqual function:
```
import React from 'react';

const MyComponent = React.memo(() => {
  // component code here
}, areEqual);
```
5. React.memo with a custom hook:
```
import React from 'react';

const useMyHook = () => {
  // hook code here
};

const MyComponent = React.memo(() => {
  // component code here
}, [useMyHook]);
```
6. React.memo with a HOC (Higher-Order Component):
```
import React from 'react';

const withMemo = (WrappedComponent) => {
  return React.memo(WrappedComponent);
};

const MyComponent = withMemo(() => {
  // component code here
});
```

7. React.memo with a function component:
```
import React from 'react';

const MyComponent = React.memo(function MyComponent() {
  // component code here
});
```

8. React.memo with a class component:
```
import React from 'react';

class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    // component code here
  }
}

const MemoizedMyComponent = React.memo(MyComponent);
```

These are some of the ways you can implement React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders in React JS. The choice of implementation depends on your specific use case and requirements.

### What are the possible case to identify, where we can use react.memo ?
Here are some possible cases where you can use React.memo

1. ``Expensive calculations:`` If your component performs an expensive calculation, such as filtering a large array or transforming data, and the calculation doesn't depend on changing props or state, use React.memo to cache the result and skip recalculating it unnecessarily.

2. Frequent re-renders: If your component re-renders frequently, such as when a user scrolls through a list, and the component's props or state haven't changed, use React.memo to cache the component's output and skip re-rendering.

3. Passing props to child components: If you pass a prop to a child component and want to optimize its re-rendering performance, use React.memo to cache the calculation of the prop and skip re-rendering if it hasn't changed.

4. Optimizing re-renders of a list: If you have a list of components that re-render frequently, use React.memo to cache the components' output and skip re-rendering if the list items haven't changed.

5. Optimizing re-renders of a component with complex logic: If your component has complex logic that depends on props or state, and the logic doesn't change frequently, use React.memo to cache the result of the logic and skip recalculating it unnecessarily.

6. Optimizing re-renders of a component with external dependencies: If your component depends on external data, such as an API response, and the data doesn't change frequently, use React.memo to cache the result of the data fetch and skip refetching it unnecessarily.

7. Optimizing re-renders of a component with a complex DOM structure: If your component has a complex DOM structure that is expensive to render, use React.memo to cache the rendered DOM and skip re-rendering if the props or state haven't changed.

8. Optimizing re-renders of a component with a large number of props: If your component receives a large number of props and the props don't change frequently, use React.memo to cache the component's output and skip re-rendering if the props haven't changed.

These are just a few examples of cases where you can use React.memo to optimize the performance of your React application. The key is to identify situations where the component's output doesn't change frequently, and use React.memo to cache the output and skip unnecessary re-renders.
