## Code Splitting in ReactJS 
Here are the major points to perform code splitting for a React app:

1. Identify split points: Determine where to split your code based on functionality, routes, or components.
2. Use a bundler: Use a bundler like Webpack or Rollup to bundle your code.
3. Configure code splitting: Configure your bundler to split your code into smaller chunks.
4. Use a code splitting library: Use a library like React Loadable or SplitJs to simplify code splitting.
5. Define split chunks: Define which chunks to split and how to load them.
6. Use lazy loading: Use lazy loading to load chunks only when needed.
7. Use suspense: Use suspense to handle loading states and errors.
8. Optimize chunk sizes: Optimize chunk sizes to reduce loading times.
9. Use caching: Use caching to reduce the number of requests made.
10. Monitor and optimize: Monitor and optimize your code splitting setup to ensure optimal performance.

### Popular code splitting techniques include:

1. Route-based splitting: Split code based on routes.
2. Component-based splitting: Split code based on components.
3. Feature-based splitting: Split code based on features.
4. Dynamic import: Use dynamic import to load modules on demand.

### Popular tools and libraries for code splitting include:

1. Webpack: A popular bundler that supports code splitting.
2. React Loadable: A library that simplifies code splitting.
3. SplitJs: A library that simplifies code splitting.
4. Loadable Components: A library that simplifies code splitting.

### Best practices for code splitting include:

1. Split code into smaller chunks: Split code into smaller chunks to reduce loading times.
2. Use lazy loading: Use lazy loading to load chunks only when needed.
3. Use suspense: Use suspense to handle loading states and errors.
4. Optimize chunk sizes: Optimize chunk sizes to reduce loading times.
5. Monitor and optimize: Monitor and optimize your code splitting setup to ensure optimal performance.

By following these points and techniques, you can effectively perform code splitting for your React app and improve its performance and scalability.
