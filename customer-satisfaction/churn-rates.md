Here are the major factors that can increase churn rates for web applications:

1. *Poor User Experience*: A clunky, slow, or difficult-to-use interface can frustrate users and drive them away.
2. *Lack of Engagement*: Failing to provide engaging content, features, or interactions can lead to user boredom and abandonment.
3. *Unmet Expectations*: Not delivering on promises or failing to meet user needs can lead to disappointment and churn.
4. *Technical Issues*: Frequent errors, downtime, or bugs can frustrate users and erode trust.
5. *Competition*: Attractive alternatives or competitors can lure users away.
6. *Lack of Value*: Failing to provide value or benefits can lead users to question the application's purpose.
7. *Poor Customer Support*: Unresponsive or unhelpful support can exacerbate user frustration.
8. *Changes in User Needs*: Users' needs and preferences can shift over time, making the application less relevant.
9. *Onboarding Issues*: A confusing or overwhelming onboarding process can deter users from continued use.
10. *Lack of Personalization*: Failing to tailor the experience to individual users can lead to a sense of irrelevance.
11. *Privacy and Security Concerns*: Users may abandon an application if they feel their data is not secure or privacy is not respected.
12. *Lack of Updates and Innovation*: Stagnant development and lack of new features can lead to user boredom and churn.
13. *Difficulty in Canceling Subscription*: Making it hard for users to cancel their subscription can lead to frustration and negative word-of-mouth.
14. *Poor Communication*: Failing to communicate changes, updates, or issues can lead to user confusion and mistrust.
15. *Lack of Gamification and Incentives*: Failing to provide rewards or incentives can reduce user motivation and engagement.
16. *Unfriendly UI/UX*: An application with a poor design, layout or navigation can be off-putting to users.
17. *Lack of Mobile Optimization*: Failing to optimize the application for mobile devices can lead to a poor user experience.
18. *Lack of Social Sharing Features*: Not providing features to share content or achievements on social media can reduce user engagement.
19. *Lack of Analytics and Feedback*: Not providing users with insights into their progress or feedback on their performance can reduce user engagement.
20. *Lack of Community Building*: Failing to create a sense of community or social connection can lead to user isolation and churn.

These factors can contribute to increased churn rates, but it's important to note that each application is unique, and the specific factors that contribute to churn may vary.
