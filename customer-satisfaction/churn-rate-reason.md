Here are some steps to identify the issue:

1. *Collect Data*: Gather relevant data on user behavior, such as usage patterns, drop-off points, and feedback.
2. *Analyze User Feedback*: Review user feedback, reviews, and ratings to identify common complaints and areas of frustration.
3. *Conduct User Research*: Conduct surveys, interviews, or focus groups to gain a deeper understanding of user needs and pain points.
4. *Analyze User Behavior*: Use tools like Google Analytics to analyze user behavior, such as bounce rates, exit pages, and time spent on the application.
5. *Identify Trends and Patterns*: Look for trends and patterns in the data, such as high drop-off rates at a specific point in the application.
6. *Prioritize Issues*: Prioritize issues based on their impact on the user experience and business goals.
7. *Create a Hypothesis*: Create a hypothesis about the root cause of the issue, based on the data and research.
8. *Test and Validate*: Test and validate the hypothesis by making changes to the application and measuring the impact on user behavior.
9. *Refine and Repeat*: Refine and repeat the process until the issue is resolved.

Some specific questions to ask during this process include:

- What are the most common reasons users cancel their subscription or stop using the application?
- What are the pain points or frustrations users experience when using the application?
- What are the most common areas of the application where users get stuck or drop off?
- What are the user's goals and how can the application better meet those goals?
- What are the key metrics that indicate user engagement and retention, and how can they be improved?

By following these steps and asking these questions, you can identify the root cause of the issue and make data-driven decisions to improve the user experience and increase retention.
